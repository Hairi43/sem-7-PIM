  content: In this game, the player can move left or right, and drops will fall from
    above. The first drop you catch will set your color. Now, you must avoid other
    colors and collect only the one that matches your color. Your chosen color will
    be displayed by the color of the counter, which will reflect the color of the
    collected drop. If you catch the wrong drop, the game ends. Try to catch as many
    drops as possible.
